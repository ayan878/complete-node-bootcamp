# How node.js works: A look behind the scenes

- **node,js on several dependency like V8 and libuv**

  - **1. V8:** The JavaScript engine developed by Google that powers Chrome and is responsible for executing JavaScript code in Node.js.
  - **2. libuv:** A multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O. It provides the event loop and abstractions for file system operations, networking, and concurrency, allowing Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations efficiently.
    it also implement extremly important features of node.js - 1.Event Loop : it is written in js and C++ and it is responsible for handling easy task like excuting callback and network I/O - 2.Thread pool: it is wrttiten in C++ and it is responsible for heavy work like file access, compression etc
  - **3. npm (Node Package Manager):** While not a core part of Node.js itself, npm is a widely used package manager for JavaScript that is bundled with Node.js installations. It allows developers to easily install, manage, and share packages of code.

  - node.js itself is program which is written in Js and C++.it ties all the library together not matter written in C++ or Jsand gives developer to access their function in pure JavaScript.

- **node.js not only relies on V8 and libuv but also on http-parser, c-ares, OpenSSL,zlib.**

  - **1. http-parser**: This is a HTTP request/response parser written in C, which Node.js uses to efficiently parse HTTP messages.

  - **2. c-ares**: A C library that provides asynchronous DNS requests. Node.js uses c-ares to perform DNS lookups asynchronously, which is crucial for non-blocking I/O operations.

  - **3. OpenSSL**: A cryptography library that provides support for SSL/TLS protocols and encryption algorithms. Node.js uses OpenSSL for secure communication, such as HTTPS.

  - **4. zlib**: A compression library that provides support for gzip and deflate compression algorithms. Node.js uses zlib to compress and decompress data, which is useful for handling compressed data over the network.

# Thread, Thread-Pool, and Event Loop

- **1. Node.js Process**: When we run a Node.js program, it starts a Node.js process, which is like a container holding the program while it's running.

- **2. Single Thread**: By default, Node.js runs programs using just one thread. This thread executes instructions one by one, like following a single line of tasks.

- **3. Event Loop**: The event loop is the brain of Node.js. It handles multiple tasks efficiently without getting stuck. For example, if a program needs to read a file, the event loop instructs Node.js to start reading the file and then moves on to other tasks while waiting for the file operation to complete.

- **4. Thread Pool**: Node.js has a special pool of threads that it can use for certain tasks that benefit from multiple threads, such as reading files or performing complex calculations. These tasks happen in the background without slowing down the main program.

In simple terms, Node.js can juggle multiple tasks at once, even though it technically only does one thing at a time.


# What Happens in a Single Thread When We Start a Node.js Application

- **Initialization**: When we start a Node.js application, the program initializes by executing the top-level code. This includes loading all required modules and registering any callbacks needed for asynchronous operations.

    ```javascript
    // Example of top-level code
    const fs = require('fs');
    const http = require('http');
    ```

- **Execution of Top-Level Code**: All code present at the top level of the application is executed in sequence. This could involve variable declarations, function definitions, and other synchronous operations.

    ```javascript
    // Example of top-level code execution
    const greeting = 'Hello, World!';
    console.log(greeting);
    ```

- **Loading Required Modules**: Node.js loads all required modules, including core modules and external dependencies, to prepare the environment for execution. 

    ```javascript
    // Example of loading required modules
    const fs = require('fs');
    const http = require('http');
    ```

- **Registration of Callbacks**: Any asynchronous operations, such as file I/O or network requests, may involve registering callback functions to be executed when those operations complete.

    ```javascript
    // Example of registering callback for file read operation
    fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
        if (err) {
            console.error('Error reading file:', err);
            return;
        }
        console.log('File content:', data);
    });
    ```

- **Start Event Loop**: After initialization, Node.js starts the event loop to handle asynchronous operations and callbacks.

In essence, during the initialization phase, Node.js sets up the environment and prepares for the execution of the application's code, including any asynchronous operations that may occur.
